Choosing a different image will delete this current image.<br><br>It is important to properly discern the right type of image to use. If the image is going to be used as a page banner, then images that are landscape (more long than short) work better. When a field asks for a mobile image, then the image should be portrait (more tall than long) in dimensions. If the image is meant as a profile picture for a person, it usually is meant to be square.<br><br>Also, keep in mind that images need to be large enough in actual size so that they aren't "stretched" beyond their actual dimensions and appear blurry/pixelated. At the same time, image files need to be small in size. <strong>This allows them to be downloaded quickly and keeps your viewers from using too much cellular data if they are on a mobile device outside of a wifi zone.<br><br>This would act as a decription for the image if someone had images turned off or was using a screen reader. This is very important for SEO!</strong></p>
