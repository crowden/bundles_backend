<p class="{{ class }}">This is the text that is linked, and many times is underlined. This is very important for SEO, so be as descriptive as possible. </strong>The more keyword-rich you can make this, <strong>the better.</strong> Good link text would be something like <span class="example">an explanation of how photosynthesis works</span>, since these are the actual words people search for on Google. Bad link text would be something like <span class="example">click here</span>. This is very non-descriptive and unhelpful to both your viewers and Google.</p>
